## Course Outline
### Course Description
This course will start off by teaching you the basics of Node.js and its core modules. 
Students will then learn how to import additional modules and configure your project using npm. 
From there, you will learn how to use Express to set up a web server and how to interact with a MongoDB database using Mongoose. 
The MERN Stack is a collection of web development software, namely MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. 
The MERN Stack provides an end-to-end framework for developers to build and deploy fullstack web applications. 
This instructor-led, live training (online or onsite) is aimed at web developers who wish to use the MERN Stack for fullstack development. 
By the end of this training, participants will be able to: 
- Integrate React with MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. 
- Build a fullstack web application from scratch. 
- Implement application security through authorization and authentication.

### Course Objective
Upon successful completion of the course the student will: 
- Understand the JavaScript and technical concepts behind Node JS 
- Structure a Node application in modules 
- Build a Web Server in Node and understand how it really works 
- Use npm and manage node packages 
- Build a web application and API more easily using Express 
- Connect to a Mongo database in Node 
- Understand how the MERN stack works

### Learning Outcomes
Easy integration of client-side and the server-end. 
Build data-driven applications along with simple test, secure and deployment of the code. 
Provide a great understanding of modern tools and techniques. 
Able to design and build a web application following the industryâ€™s best practices. 
Build SPAs with the industries best practices. MERN stack developers have high pay roles. 
Maintain the code isomerism as Javascript used throughout the project. 
Reduction in cost of disk space as a project is cloud compatible. 
Abundance career and job opportunities follow.
